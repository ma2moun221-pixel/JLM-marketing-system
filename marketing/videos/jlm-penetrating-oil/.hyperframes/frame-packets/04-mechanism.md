## Frame 4 — How it works: inside the thread

- scene: Out of the blue drop, a yellow oil drop falls into a cutaway of a rusted bolt inside its nut. Oil penetrates the threads, rust dissolves, moisture is pushed out, and a protective film coats everything. The bolt then spins free.

  - A yellow `#FAB817` regular **hexagon outline** (bolt head, top view), stroke 10 px, circumradius 150, centre (540, 760), flat-top orientation.
  - The hexagon is **rotating clockwise at 90°/s**; at the cut its rotation is exactly 0° (flat-top).
  - Nothing else visible.

Compose: a technical cutaway in a blueprint style, built from silver hairline SVG on ink, with numbered steps.

- Scene 1 (0.0–1.4s): The blue field irises down into a single **yellow oil drop** (teardrop, ~140 px tall) at (540, 520), while the ink ground and a faint silver grid appear.
  - The drop falls on a gentle arc to (540, 760), onto the top of the cutaway.
  - The cutaway draws itself (→ `svg-path-draw`): a vertical bolt shank, with sawtooth threads on both flanks, inside nut walls. It spans x 300–780, y 760–1500, in silver hairlines.
  - The gaps between bolt and nut threads hold **rust** (brown granules, seeded) and **moisture** (small silver-blue droplets).
- Scene 2 (1.7–4.9s): Step **1 «يخترق بعمق»** appears as a label: a yellow number disc "1" (Albert Sans 800) with off-white Arabic 700 ~52 px, top-left at (100, 300), RTL.
  - Yellow oil **creeps down the thread gaps** as a glowing path that follows the zigzag, reaching the bottom by 4.5 s ("بعمق").
- Scene 3 (5.3–6.2s): Step **2 «يذيب الصدأ»**. The rust granules touched by oil shrink and dissolve with tiny yellow sparkles (→ `particle-burst`, small).
- Scene 4 (6.2–7.8s): Step **3 «يطرد الرطوبة»**. The moisture droplets are pushed outward and up, out of the thread gaps, and leave the frame.
- Scene 5 (7.9–10.6s): Step **4 «يزيّت ويحمي»**. A thin glowing yellow film coats every thread flank. A shield line-icon (silver, ~110 px) draws itself beside the label. The label list now shows 1–4 stacked; the earlier steps are dimmed to 45 %.
- Scene 6 (10.7–12.3s): "طويلة الأمد": the cutaway fades to 20 % and the camera tilts to top-down.
  - The bolt head is seen from above as the yellow hexagon (circumradius 150, centre (540, 760)), and it **spins freely**: the bolt is loosened.
  - The rotation reaches a steady clockwise 90°/s and is exactly 0° at the cut (12.3 s).
  - Everything else is gone by 12.1 s.

# Particle Burst

Discrete flying particles as a one-shot event: a **confetti pop** that erupts upward and drifts back down on gravity, a **dot burst** radiating from behind a landing word, or a **glyph dissolve** where text breaks into particles that scatter and die. Particles are ephemeral garnish — born from a beat, fly, gone; they never become layout.

Boundaries: [css-marker-patterns.md](css-marker-patterns.md)'s burst mode is radiating **drawn lines** — a static accent, no flight. [press-release-spring.md](press-release-spring.md)'s release burst is **one blurred radial layer** faking an explosion — enough when a single glow pop will do. [center-outward-expansion.md](center-outward-expansion.md) moves **real layout elements** to final resting slots; particles have no destination, only physics and a death.

## How It Works

The whole event is **one driver tween and one formula**:

1. **Seeded setup** — a fixed pool of `PARTICLE_COUNT` small divs is created once at composition setup (a deterministic loop — setup-time generation is fine; per-frame DOM creation is not). Each particle `i` derives everything from a pure hash:

   ```js
   // angle, speed, size, spin, color (palette[i % palette.length]) — all from prand(i * k)
   const prand = (n) => {
     const x = Math.sin(n * 127.1 + 311.7) * 43758.5453;
     return x - Math.floor(x); // 0..1, pure function of n
   };
   ```

2. **Ballistic formula** — a proxy tween advances `T: 0 → 1` over `FLIGHT_DUR` with `ease: "none"`; `onUpdate` positions every particle as a **pure function of T**:

   ```
   x(T) = vx · T·FLIGHT_DUR
   y(T) = vy · T·FLIGHT_DUR + ½ · G · (T·FLIGHT_DUR)²
   rot(T) = spin · T·FLIGHT_DUR
   ```

   Gravity `G` supplies the rise-decelerate-fall arc for free. Because position is computed from `T` (never accumulated per frame), a seek to any moment renders the exact mid-flight state — this is what makes DOM particles seek-safe. The driver's `ease: "none"` is load-bearing: the physics lives in the formula; an eased driver warps gravity and the arc stops reading as thrown objects.

3. **Death** — an opacity tail inside the same formula (fade over the last `FADE_FRAC` of flight), or the confetti signature: a separate **instant-shrink** tween scaling the pool to 0 in a blink at flight end. Either way the particles end invisible and stay invisible.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="burst-stage">
  <div class="particle-field" id="particle-field"></div>
  <div class="burst-hero" id="burst-hero">{heroWord}</div>
</div>
```

```css
/* .burst-stage: position: relative; display: grid; place-items: center.
   .burst-hero: z-index: 2 — particles fly BEHIND the word. */
.particle-field {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 1;
  left: 50%;
  top: 50%; /* the launch origin — offset to taste (e.g. the word's baseline) */
  width: 0;
  height: 0;
}
.particle {
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
  top: 0;
  border-radius: 2px; /* confetti chip; 50% for dots */
  opacity: 0; /* invisible until the event fires */
  will-change: transform, opacity;
}
```

```js
// Setup: deterministic pool, generated ONCE.
const field = document.getElementById("particle-field");
const palette = ["{accentA}", "{accentB}", "{accentC}"]; // 3-5 brand tokens
const parts = [];
for (let i = 0; i < PARTICLE_COUNT; i++) {
  const el = document.createElement("div");
  el.className = "particle";
  const size = SIZE_MIN + prand(i * 3 + 1) * (SIZE_MAX - SIZE_MIN);
  el.style.width = `${size}px`;
  el.style.height = `${size * 0.7}px`; // slightly oblong = confetti chip
  el.style.background = palette[i % palette.length];
  field.appendChild(el);
  // Index-seeded launch parameters — the particle's whole life, fixed here.
  const angle = -Math.PI / 2 + (prand(i * 5 + 2) * 2 - 1) * CONE; // upward cone
  const speed = SPEED_MIN + prand(i * 7 + 3) * (SPEED_MAX - SPEED_MIN);
  parts.push({
    el,
    vx: Math.cos(angle) * speed,
    vy: Math.sin(angle) * speed, // negative = up
    spin: (prand(i * 11 + 4) * 2 - 1) * SPIN_MAX,
  });
}

// Confetti pop — one driver, pure ballistic formula.
const drive = { T: 0 };
tl.fromTo(
  drive,
  { T: 0 },
  {
    T: 1,
    duration: FLIGHT_DUR,
    ease: "none", // physics lives in the formula, not the ease
    onUpdate: () => {
      const t = drive.T * FLIGHT_DUR; // seconds of flight — pure function of T
      const fade = Math.min(1, (1 - drive.T) / FADE_FRAC); // opacity tail
      parts.forEach((p) => {
        const x = p.vx * t;
        const y = p.vy * t + 0.5 * G * t * t; // rise, stall, drift down
        p.el.style.transform = `translate(${x}px, ${y}px) rotate(${p.spin * t}deg)`;
        p.el.style.opacity = String(drive.T === 0 ? 0 : fade); // T===0 guard covers seeks before the event
      });
    },
  },
  BURST_AT,
);
```

## Variations

- **Confetti pop, then instant-shrink** — the playful signature: full burst, gravity drift, then every chip scales to 0 in a blink: `FADE_FRAC` near 0, plus `tl.to(".particle", { scale: 0, duration: SHRINK_DUR, ease: "power2.in" }, BURST_AT + FLIGHT_DUR - SHRINK_DUR)` with `SHRINK_DUR` 0.15–0.25s. Keep the whole event tiny relative to the subject — a garnish measured in a few dozen pixels, not a screen-filling cannon.
- **Dot burst behind a landing word** — radial instead of a cone: `angle = prand(i) * Math.PI * 2`, `G` near 0, short flight (0.4–0.7s), round dots (`border-radius: 50%`), pool z-indexed behind the word. Fire at the word's settle frame.
- **Glyph dissolve** — seed each particle's **origin** across the glyph block's box (`ox = (prand(i*13) - 0.5) * BLOCK_W`, same for `oy`, added inside the transform), gentle outward drift with low `G`; text fades out over the first ~30% of flight while particles fade in from its silhouette. Color every particle `{textColor}` so the swarm reads as the text's own material. (True per-pixel dissolves are Canvas-2D territory — `techniques.md`; this DOM version sells it up to ~40 particles.)
- **Two-stage burst (pop + stragglers)** — split the pool: 70% on the main driver, 30% on a second driver ~0.12s later with lower speeds; the split is index-derived (`i % 10 < 3`). Same formula, two windows.

## Critical Constraints

- **Position is a pure function of time, driver ease `"none"`** — `x(T)`, `y(T)`, `rot(T)` computed from the driver value every frame, never accumulated (`+=`) per tick (accumulation breaks the moment the renderer seeks); gravity is the ease — an eased driver bends the parabola.
- **Fixed pool, no per-frame DOM** — all particles exist after setup with `opacity: 0`; the event only writes `transform` / `opacity`. **`PARTICLE_COUNT ≤ ~40`** — per-frame style writes scale linearly; keep the event cheap.
- **Particles start AND end at `opacity: 0`** — the `drive.T === 0` guard covers seeks to before the event; the tail/shrink covers after. A chip frozen mid-air at driver end is a bug every subsequent frame.
- **Particles are punctuation** — one event per beat, fired on a cause, small relative to the subject, dead before the next beat; z-ordered behind or around the word it celebrates, never over it. A persistent particle system is a background, and that's not this rule.

# SVG Path Draw

Reveals an SVG shape by animating its stroke as if a pen were tracing it. Two stroke properties together: **`stroke-dasharray = <pathLength>`** makes the entire path one dash; **`stroke-dashoffset`** starts at the path length (dash shifted fully out of view → invisible) and tweens to `0` (fully drawn). The length comes from the DOM API `path.getTotalLength()` — measured, never guessed.

Works on anything with a stroke: `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`, `<polyline>`, `<polygon>`, `<ellipse>`.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip -->
<svg class="logo-mark" viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path id="bar-left" d="M 60 40 L 60 160" />
  <path id="bar-right" d="M 140 40 L 140 160" />
  <path id="bar-mid" d="M 60 100 L 140 100" />
</svg>
```

```css
.logo-mark path {
  fill: none; /* outline-only draw — a fill would appear immediately and ruin the reveal */
  stroke: {accentColor};
  stroke-width: 12;
  stroke-linecap: round; /* softer endpoints */
  stroke-linejoin: round;
}
```

```js
// Setup: measure each path and set its dash pattern. Real measured geometry, not a magic number.
document.querySelectorAll(".logo-mark path").forEach((p) => {
  const len = p.getTotalLength();
  p.style.strokeDasharray = `${len}`;
  p.style.strokeDashoffset = `${len}`;
});

// Stagger draws so the eye reads continuous motion — each segment starts at
// ~70-80% of the previous segment's duration, before it finishes.
tl.to(
  "#bar-left",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-right",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_2_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-mid",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_3_START,
);

// Companion wordmark fades in only after the last stroke settles.
tl.to(
  ".brand-line",
  { opacity: 1, duration: BRAND_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  BRAND_FADE_START,
);
```

## Variations

- **Ring starting at 12 o'clock** — `<circle>` / `<rect>` strokes start at 3 o'clock by default; rotate the element `-90deg` so a progress ring draws from the top:

```html
<circle
  cx="100"
  cy="100"
  r="60"
  id="ring"
  style="transform-origin: 100px 100px; transform: rotate(-90deg)"
/>
```

- **Linear (constant-speed) draw** — `ease: "none"` for a steady-rate "real pen" trace.
- **Draw then fill** — for filled shapes, tween `fillOpacity: 0 → 1` AFTER the stroke completes (requires `fill-opacity: 0` initially and a real `fill` in CSS):

```js
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { fillOpacity: 1, duration: FILL_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  SEG_1_START + SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR,
);
```

| SEG_1_START       | 0–0.4s                                  | a small ~0.2s lead-in lets the viewer settle before motion                                         |
| BRAND_FADE_START  | ≥ last stroke end (+ ~0.2s beat)        | earlier and the wordmark competes with the draw                                                    |

Ease families are discrete choices: **stroke draws** use `power2.out` (a hand lifting at end of stroke) or `none` for constant speed — never `back.out` / `elastic.out` (pens don't bounce). **Fades** use `power1.out`.

## Critical Constraints

- **`fill: none`** for outline-only draws — otherwise the fill appears immediately.
- **Dasharray/dashoffset = the measured `getTotalLength()`**, set at setup; requires the SVG in the DOM (inline SVG is fine; a loaded `<image>` SVG is not).
- **Complex paths**: if `getTotalLength()` looks wrong, overestimate slightly (`len * 1.05`) — too large is invisible at animation start; too small clips the end.
- **Stagger multi-path draws at ~70–80%** of the previous segment's duration.
- **A drawn line must land on something.** When the path is a connector (rail, beam, underline, callout) rather than a shape, both endpoints must sit on real elements and the draw must do a job — reveal, route, validate, or emphasize. A stroke that only decorates empty space reads as filler; attach it or cut it.
